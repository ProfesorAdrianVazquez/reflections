When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I can work collaborative with another collegues.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks make copy in Github; clone make a copy from the hithub to local machine or from local machine to local machine;

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
